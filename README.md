# Code-Visualization-using-Virtual-Reality
Windows app which allows debugging to be done in a virtual space

We created a virtual space in windows using Unity3d. This virtual space has several screens and a 360 degree view. Debugging of simple C++ program can be done using this software.

To know how to use this app, read the Final BTP report file.


In Linux, download the files in the folder 'Linux Side'. Copy your C++ code to main.cpp file. and run the script.
Few new files will be generated. Copy and paste them to the 'Asset' folder present in the Unity Side, replacing the already existing ones.
Now open Menu.unity and build the project.
